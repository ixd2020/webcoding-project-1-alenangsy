    <p>
      Shawn Peter Raul Mendes is a Canadian singer and songwriter. He gained a
      following in 2013, posting song covers on the video-sharing application
      Vine. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager Andrew
      Gertler and Island Records A&R Ziggy Chareton, which led to him signing a
      deal with the record label. He has since released three studio albums,
      headlined three world tours, and received several awards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mendes released his self-titled debut EP (2014) and his debut studio album
      Handwritten (2015), whose single "Stitches" reached number one in the
      United Kingdom and the top 10 in the United States and Canada. He then
      released his second studio album Illuminate (2016), whose singles "Treat
      You Better" and "There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back" reached the top 10 in
      several countries. His self-titled third studio album (2018) was supported
      by the lead single "In My Blood".
    </p>

    <p>
      All three albums debuted atop the US Billboard 200, with the first one
      making Mendes one of five artists ever to debut at number one before the
      age of 18 and the third one making him the third-youngest artist to
      achieve three number one albums. In 2017, Mendes became the first artist
      to land three number-one singles on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart
      before turning 20 years old. In 2018, he became the first artist to
      achieve four number-one singles on the Adult Pop Songs chart before the
      age of 20 as well. In 2019, he released the hit singles "If I Can't Have
      You" and "Señorita", with the latter peaking at number one on the US
      Billboard Hot 100.

    <h4>
      Early Life
    </h4>
    <p>
      Mendes was born in the city of Pickering, Ontario, to Karen (née Rayment),
      a real estate agent, and Manuel Mendes, a businessman, who sells bar and
      restaurant supplies in Toronto. His father is Portuguese (from the
      Algarve), while his mother is from England. He has a younger sister named
      Aaliyah. He was raised in a religious family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mendes was raised in Pickering where he attended Pine Ridge Secondary
      School. At school, he played ice hockey and soccer, joined his high school
      glee club, and practised his stage presence in acting lessons (leading as
      Prince Charming at one point). He also auditioned for Disney Channel in
      Toronto. Mendes graduated from high school in June 2016.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Career
    </h4>

    <p>
      Mendes learned to play guitar by watching YouTube tutorial videos at the
      age of 14 in 2012. Less than a year later he started posting cover videos
      on YouTube. Mendes started attracting viewers after he posted a cover from
      Justin Bieber's "As Long as You Love Me" on the social video app Vine in
      2013 and got 10,000 likes and as many followers the next day. After that
      he gained millions of views and followers in a few months, becoming well
      known for his six-second snippets of renditions of many popular songs.
      Mendes saw Bieber as a career model at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      By August 2014, he was the third most-followed musician on Vine. Artist
      manager Andrew Gertler discovered Mendes online in November 2013, bringing
      him to Island Records in January 2014. In April, he won Ryan Seacrest's
      "Best Cover Song" contest with "Say Something" by A Great Big World. He
      officially signed to Island in May 2014.
